- HTML5 Text Formatting - Paragraph, Pre, and Abbr Tags

    - The 'p' tag defines a paragraph.

        <p>This is an example of a paragraph, containing text sentences.</p>   


    - The 'pre' tag defines an area of preformatted text.

        <pre>            
              88  
             8888  
             8888  
            888888
        </pre>


    - The 'abbr' tag is used to create an abbreviation which will display the full text
        when moused over.

        <p>Christmas Tree is also <abbr title="Christmas">XMAS</abbr> Tree!</p>



- HTML5 Text Styling - Bold, Italics, and Underline

    - According to the HTML5 specification, the 'b', 'i', and 'u' tags are still supported,
        but should only be used as a last resort.  CSS styles should be used instead
        wherever possible.


    - The 'b' tag defines an area of bold text.

        <p> This is normal text. <b> This is bold text.</b> </p>


    - The 'i' tag defines an area of italic text.

        <p> This is normal text. <i> This is italic text.</i> </p>


    - The 'u' tag defines an area of underlined text.

        <p> This is normal text. <u> This is underlined text.</u> </p>



- HTML5 Break Tags - Line Break and Word Break

    - The 'wbr' tag is used to add a word break, which uses a hyphen to break a long
        word across lines.

        <p>This is an example of a word which is really long using word break:
        Pneumono<wbr>ultramicroscopic<wbr>silico<wbr>volcano<wbr>coniosis</p>


    - The 'br' tag is used to add a line break.

        <p>This is an example of using the line break tag to break apart<br>            
        a paragraph containing text sentences<br>            
        without using multiple paragraph tags.<br><br>            
        It is possible to put line spacing between your sentences<br>            
        and still use only one single paragraph.</p>



- HTML5 Text Size - Small, Superscript, and Subscript

    - The 'small' tag is used to create small text in a sentence.

        <p>An example of <small>small text</small> contained in a sentence.</p>


    - The 'sup' tag is used to add superscript.

        <p>Ten Squared Equals One Hundred: 10<sup>2</sup> = 100</p>


    - The 'sub' tag is used to add subscript.

        <p>Further Research Material<sub>[1]</sub> is in the Footer.</p>



- HTML5 Text Direction - The Bidirectional Text Tags

    - The 'bdi' and 'bdo' tags are used to tell the rendering engine which direction the
        text should go.  The options are left-to-right and right-to-left.

      The 'bdi' tag is used to create an isolated (don't apply current document's text 
        direction) portion of text with a specified direction.

        <p>An example of <bdi>isolated text</bdi> contained in a sentence.</p>


    - The 'bdo' tag is used to override the default text direction.  The 'dir' attribute
        which specifies the direction is required.

        <p>Override this to create <bdo dir="rtl">right to left</bdo>text.</p>



- HTML5 Text Quotes - Quote and Blockquote Tags

    - The 'q' tag tells the rendering engine that the enclosed text is a quote.  This tag
        will add the quotation marks for you.  Optionally, the 'cite' attribute can be supplied
        to source the quote with a URL.

        <q cite="http://www.wallacejackson.com>
        This is a sample quotation from the Author of HTML5 Quick Markup Reference.
        </q>


    - The 'blockquote' tag is used for longer quotations, taken from another source.  Most 
        browsers will indent the content in this tag.

        <blockquote cite="http://www.apress.com/9781484218624">            
        This compact quick scripting syntax reference on JSON covers
        syntax and parameters central to JSON object definitions, using
        the NetBeans 8.1 open source and Eclipse IDE software tool packages.
        </blockquote>            



- HTML5 Text Citations - The Cite Tag

    - The 'cite' tag tells the rendering engine to apply a title citation for an 
        intellectual property work to any text inside the tags.

        <p>I wrote <cite>JSON Quick Syntax Reference</cite> during 2016.</p>




- HTML5 Text Special Circumstances - Other Tags

    - The 'data' tag provides machine-readable data.  It is useful in cases in which data
        needs to be in a certain format to be processed using JavaScript, but does not
        format well for human-readable applications.

      For instance, maybe we want to present numeric values to users as strings ('one', 'two'),
        but you also need numerical representations so they can be sorted.

        <p>An example of <data> tags contained in a paragraph. Numbers Include:
            <data value="1">One</data>
            <data value="2">Two</data>
            <data value="3">Three</data>
        </p>


    - The 's' tag is used for strikethrough text.

        <p>I wrote <s>Android Apps for Absolute Beginners 1st Ed.</s> in 2010.</p>

      This tag is now deprecated and CSS should be used instead.

        s { text-decoration: line-through; }


    - The 'del' tag is used for text that has been deleted and replaced using the 'ins'
        tag.

        <p>My favorite team is the <del>Steelers</del> <ins>Browns</ins>.</p>
